This is the vanilla Quake source experiment that aims only to be faster with the 80486 CPU in mind.  

It is not Engoo.  It's not going to have featurecreep.  

If it makes Quake slower and look better, it's not going here.  

If it makes Quake in 1080p for Windows 7, it's not going here.  

If it removes ASM code for C unroll hell and crossing fingers with great optimism that GCC is the king of optimization, it's not going here.

If it's SDL, it's not going here.

If it makes Quake not choke so much on very old PCs, it's going here.
